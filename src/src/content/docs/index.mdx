title: Welcome to the Asya Project Documentation!
---

**Asya** is your personal computer assistant, designed to handle routine tasks, assist with computer work, search the web, tell jokes, and much more! This project aims to make your daily work easier and more enjoyable.

---

## 🎯 What Can Asya Do?

Asya can help you with a wide variety of tasks. Here are a few examples:

- **Opening applications**:  
  _“Asya, open Minecraft.”_
  
- **Controlling music**:  
  _“Asya dear, play some classic tunes.”_

- **Sharing interesting facts**:  
  _“Tell me about the planets in the Solar System.”_

And so much more! Asya uses neural networks to understand your requests and generate responses, making her capabilities continually expandable.

## 🔧 Extending Functionality

If you find that a specific feature is missing, you can add it yourself! The project supports **plugins** that can be seamlessly integrated into the system.

**Example of an existing plugin**:  
- Interacting with Asya through a Telegram bot.  

**Future plans**:
- Developing a desktop application for Asya.  
- Animating Asya so she can interact with desktop objects and users.

If you’d like to contribute, join us! We’re actively looking for programmers and artists. Any help is welcome.

## 🚀 Technical Details

The project features a modular structure and consists of two main components:

1. **Daemon**  
   This is a background process responsible for all of Asya's internal logic, such as opening applications, controlling music, and more. The daemon is written in **Rust** and runs at system startup.

2. **Client**  
   This is Asya's user interface, through which you can interact with the assistant. The client communicates with the daemon via WebSocket. Currently, the client is under development. If you'd like to help, feel free to use any tech stack you prefer!
